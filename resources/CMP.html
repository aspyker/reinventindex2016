        <span class="abstract">Scaling allows cloud resources to scale automatically in reaction to the dynamic needs of customers. This session will show how Auto Scaling offers an advantage to everyone &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s basic fleet management to keep instances healthy as an EC2 best practice, or dynamic scaling to manage &ldquo;extremes&rdquo;.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll share examples of how Auto Scaling is helping customers of all sizes and industries unlock use cases and value. We&rsquo;ll also discuss how Auto Scaling is evolving to scaling different types of elastic AWS resources beyond EC2 instances. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) / California Institute of Technology will share how Auto Scaling is used to scale science data processing of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from earth-observing satellite missions, and reduce response times during hazard response events such as those from earthquakes, floods, and volcanoes. JPL will also discuss how they are integrating their science data systems with the AWS ecosystem to expand into NASA&rsquo;s next two large-scale missions with remote-sensing radar-based observations. Learn how Auto Scaling is being used at a global scale &ndash; and beyond!</span>

        <span class="abstract">Over the last year, Yelp has transitioned its scalable and reliable parallel task execution system, Seagull, from On-Demand and Reserved Instances entirely to Spot Fleet. Seagull runs over 28 million tests per day, launches more than 2.5 million Docker containers per day, and uses over 10,000 vCPUs in Spot Fleet at peak capacity. To deal with rising infrastructure costs for Seagull, we have extended our in-house Auto Scaling Engine called FleetMiser to scale the Spot Fleet in response to demand. FleetMiser has reduced Seagull&rsquo;s cluster costs by 60% in the past year and saved Yelp thousands of dollars every month.

In this session, we describe how Yelp uses Spot Fleet for Seagull and lessons we&rsquo;ve learned over the past year, along with our recommendations on how to use it reliably (pro tip: don&rsquo;t get outbid for your whole Spot Fleet). We conclude by looking at our future plans for extending Spot Fleet usage at Yelp.</span>

        <span class="abstract">A worldwide dynamic website infrastructure at the cost and simplicity of a static deployment was once an unachievable dream.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s no longer the case with the tools and services that AWS offers like Amazon CloudFront, Amazon S3, Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.&nbsp; During this session we will discuss a DevOps approach to managing your code repositories, code quality, continuous integration and deployments. We discuss some static website generators such as mkdocs, Jekyll, and middleman for building knowledge bases, blogs and websites in a serverless architecture.

Featuring an ideal use case for implementing a serverless architecture combining Amazon CloudFront, Amazon S3 and Amazon API Gateway; we explore how we deployed a massively scaled web application for a fraction of the cost of traditional dynamic websites leveraging a world-wide CDN. Going serverless significantly reduced operational costs and complexity because the infrastructure scales on demand without having to manually provision new servers on the ready. Finally, we share the lessons learned and the advantages of this move, leveraging Cloudnexa&rsquo;s vNOC product which allows for a faster, more affordable user experience. &nbsp;Session sponsored by&nbsp;Cloudnexa.

        <span class="abstract">At Librato, a Solarwinds company, we run hundreds of Cassandra instances across multiple rings and use it as our primary data store. In the past year, we embarked on a process to upgrade our fleet of Cassandra Amazon EC2 instances from instance store to instances using Amazon EBS and attached elastic network interfaces (ENIs). We find running Cassandra on EBS gives us the flexibility to choose the best instances for the best performance of our workload while saving us significant costs on infrastructure. In this session, we discuss how Librato operates Cassandra on EBS. Topics include how we chose the right instance for our workload, use detached EBS volumes and ENI mobility to reduce MTTR, use mixed EBS storage types for the best cost/performance tradeoff, debug performance issues, and continuously monitor Cassandra to get the most from AWS. We also look at performance tradeoffs made in the implementation of storage engines of large data systems like Cassandra.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Each of the four distinct compute services available from AWS bring unique advantages to your application's design: Amazon EC2, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda. However, your security responsibilities change with each of these services. For example, with Amazon EC2 and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you need a plan to lock down the operating system, your applications, and your data. Containers running in Amazon ECS provides additional flexibility and mobility but also introduces new challenges as most security techniques were not designed with containers in mind. AWS Lambda requires a completely new approach to security design at the function level.

Making sure that the diversity available in AWS compute services doesn't increase your operational burden is a significant challenge. But with the right strategy, you can use a unified approach and reduce team impact. In this session, we look at an overall security strategy for AWS compute services pulled from real-world experiences of some top global companies. Strategy in hand, we apply the strategy to each of the available compute services in order to create a unified security view for workloads, regardless of their scale.

        <span class="abstract">Amazon EC2 allows you to bid for and run spare EC2 capacity, known as Spot instances, in a dynamically priced market. On average, customers save 80% to 90% compared to On Demand prices by using Spot instances. Achieving these savings has historically required time and effort to find the best deals while managing compute capacity as supply and demand fluctuate.

&nbsp;

In this session, we dive into how customers who have designed scalable, cloud friendly application architectures can leverage new Spot features to realize immediate cost savings while maintaining availability.
